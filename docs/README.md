# Documentation
This area of the project details the process of creation and project management entailed during the development of this project.

## Requirements
Even though the requirements are self-conflicted they are still a pivitol step in creating a product. The stakeholder requirements determine the design, architecture, and implementation of the project. I have written the requirements as the User Story template.

The starting requirements are as follows:
1. [AS A user, I WANT TO see an example of a data structure, SO THAT I can understand the data structure](#3)
2. [AS A user, I WANT TO choose what data structure or algorithm I can see, SO THAT I can explore the different data structures and algorithms](#4)
3. [AS A user, I WANT TO visualise the data structure or algorithm being manipulated or ran, SO THAT I can understand how the data structure or algorithm changes](#5)
4. [AS A user, I WANT TO manipulate data structures and algorithms, SO THAT I can see how the data structure or algorithm changes based on events](#6)
5. [AS A user, I WANT TO step through the changes made on a data structure or algorithm, SO THAT I can understand how it reacts step-by-step](#7)
6. [AS A user, I WANT TO import my own data, SO THAT I can apply the data structure or algorithm to my own mutated data](#8)
## User Interface
The user interface is the first design to be done, it is the most important as it is what governs how the users iteract with the application.

Ensuring the interface is user friendly and intuitive is difficult, however, luckily for this application there were very few requirements.

## Architecture
