# Data Structures & Algorithms Visualiser
This project acts as learning tool for programmers to learn and develop their data structure and algorithm knowledge. This project was inspired by [trekhleb/javascript-algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms) and is now developed into TypeScript to allow for knowledge of both JavaScript and TypeScript implementations of such data structures and algorithms.

Not only does this project allow the programmer to explore the way these data structures and algorithms are written but the website related to this project [insert link here] allows non-programmers or true beginners to visualise and interact with these data structures and algorithms.

This project serves a teriary reason, and that is to improve my own knowledge of data structures and algorithms and their manipulation.

## Data Structures
A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Algorithms by Topic
An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.
